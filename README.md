Hello there!
Welcome to EastParts, my latest project â€” a full-stack web application where users can browse and purchase automotive parts to repair or upgrade their vehicles.

This project is a big step up from my previous one (AutoHub), which focused solely on backend development. With EastParts, I'm diving into both frontend and backend development to build a complete, dynamic shopping experience.

ðŸ”§ Tech Stack
Backend: ASP.NET Core, C#, Entity Framework Core, MSSQL

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript 

Database: Structured and seeded with automotive brands, models, categories, and products

âœ¨ Features (planned & in-progress)
Browse parts by brand, model, and category

View detailed specs and prices for each product

Future: Shopping cart, checkout, user login/register
